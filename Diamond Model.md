# Diamond Model of Intrusion Analysis

## Overview
The **Diamond Model of Intrusion Analysis** is a structured framework used for understanding and analyzing cyber threats. It provides a way to break down and classify cyber attacks based on four key elements: **Adversary, Capability, Infrastructure, and Victim**.

## Core Components

### 1. Four Core Elements of the Diamond Model
- **Adversary**: The threat actor or group carrying out the attack.
- **Capability**: The tools, malware, exploits, and techniques used by the adversary.
- **Infrastructure**: The systems, servers, and networks used by the attacker to execute the attack.
- **Victim**: The targeted organization, system, or individual affected by the attack.

### 2. Relationships Between Elements
- The **Adversary** uses a **Capability** via an **Infrastructure** to target a **Victim**.
- Analysts can pivot between these elements to track, correlate, and detect adversary behavior.

## Use Cases in SOC Operations
- **Threat Attribution**: Identifying attack groups by linking infrastructure and techniques.
- **Incident Response**: Mapping attack paths to understand how intrusions unfold.
- **Threat Intelligence**: Enhancing threat hunting by correlating indicators of compromise (IOCs) with adversary behavior.
- **Detection Engineering**: Creating SIEM rules and alerts based on attack techniques.

## How SOC Analysts Use the Diamond Model
- **Data Correlation**: Linking attack events using the four elements to identify patterns.
- **Threat Hunting**: Investigating adversary infrastructure to preemptively block threats.
- **Malware & Log Analysis**: Associating malware behavior with adversary techniques.
- **Incident Reports**: Structuring attack details in a clear and actionable format.

## Integration with Other Frameworks
- **MITRE ATT&CK**: Maps adversary techniques to capabilities in the Diamond Model.
- **Cyber Kill Chain**: Aligns with attack phases to understand attack progression.
- **NIST CSF**: Helps implement detection and response strategies within an organization.

## Conclusion
The Diamond Model is a powerful tool for SOC analysts to analyze, detect, and respond to cyber threats effectively. By leveraging this model, analysts can improve **threat attribution, detection strategies, and incident response processes**.
