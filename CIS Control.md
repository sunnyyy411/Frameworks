# CIS Controls: A SOC Analystâ€™s Guide

## 1. Introduction to CIS Controls
CIS (Center for Internet Security) Controls are a set of best practices designed to strengthen an organization's security posture. They help SOC analysts detect, respond to, and mitigate threats. CIS differs from other frameworks (NIST, ISO 27001, MITRE ATT&CK) by providing prioritized, actionable security steps.

## 2. Structure of CIS Controls
CIS Controls are categorized into three groups:
- **Basic Controls (1-6):** Essential security measures
- **Foundational Controls (7-16):** Advanced security practices
- **Organizational Controls (17-18):** Governance and compliance

## 3. Breakdown of CIS Controls Relevant for SOC Analysts

### ðŸ”¹ Basic Controls (Key for SOC Monitoring & Response)
- **Inventory & Control of Enterprise Assets:** Monitoring hardware and virtual assets
- **Inventory & Control of Software Assets:** Identifying unauthorized software
- **Data Protection:** Encrypting, classifying, and monitoring sensitive data
- **Secure Configuration of Enterprise Assets:** Hardening systems against attacks
- **Account Management:** Managing user privileges and monitoring login attempts
- **Access Control Management:** Implementing least privilege and MFA

### ðŸ”¹ Foundational Controls (SOC Threat Detection & Incident Handling)
- **Continuous Vulnerability Management:** Scanning and patching vulnerabilities
- **Audit Log Management:** Collecting and analyzing logs in SIEM
- **Email & Web Browser Protections:** Detecting phishing and web-based threats
- **Malware Defenses:** Using EDR, antivirus, and behavioral monitoring
- **Data Recovery:** Ensuring backup integrity and disaster recovery plans
- **Network Infrastructure Management:** Monitoring firewall, IDS, IPS logs
- **Security Awareness Training:** Educating users on cyber threats
- **Service Provider Management:** Securing third-party vendors
- **Application Security:** Protecting web apps and APIs
- **Incident Response Management:** Detecting, responding, and recovering from cyber incidents

### ðŸ”¹ Organizational Controls (Security Strategy & Compliance)
- **Penetration Testing:** Simulating real-world attacks
- **Security Governance:** Policies, risk assessments, compliance

## 4. How SOC Analysts Use CIS Controls in Daily Operations
- **Using SIEM (Splunk, ELK, Sentinel)** for CIS logging best practices
- **Detecting unauthorized assets and software** using CIS guidelines
- **Monitoring login attempts and privilege escalations** (Control 5 & 6)
- **Responding to vulnerabilities and malware attacks** as per CIS standards
- **Ensuring compliance with CIS Controls** in security audits

## 5. Hands-on Practice for SOC Analysts
- **Mapping security alerts in SIEM to CIS Controls**
- **Using OpenCIS-CAT (CIS Benchmarking Tool)** to assess compliance
- **Writing detection rules in Snort/Suricata** based on CIS guidelines
- **Simulating attacks and verifying CIS-aligned security measures**

Understanding CIS Controls enables SOC Analysts to enhance security monitoring and response effectively.
