# Frameworks Repository

## Overview

This repository contains essential cybersecurity frameworks used by SOC Analysts for threat detection, incident response, and security operations. Each framework is structured in a cheat sheet format for quick reference.

## Contents

### 1. NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF)
- Risk-based approach to cybersecurity
- Five core functions: Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, Recover
- Implementation tiers for maturity assessment

### 2. SANS PICERL Incident Response Framework
- Structured incident response methodology: Preparation, Identification, Containment, Eradication, Recovery, Lessons Learned
- Essential for SOC operations and IR teams
- Use cases: Phishing, Ransomware, Brute-Force, Insider Threats

### 3. MITRE ATT&CK Framework
- Adversary tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) for threat hunting
- Helps SOC teams detect and mitigate cyber attacks
- Mapped to real-world attack scenarios

### 4. Cyber Kill Chain
- Step-by-step model for understanding cyber attacks
- Helps SOC teams detect, prevent, and respond to threats at each attack stage
- Includes Reconnaissance, Weaponization, Delivery, Exploitation, Installation, C2, Actions on Objectives

### 5. CIS Controls (Center for Internet Security)
- Prioritized security best practices for organizations
- Categorized into Basic, Foundational, and Organizational Controls
- Helps SOC teams enhance security monitoring and compliance

### 6. OWASP Top 10
- Industry-standard list of the most critical web application security risks
- Updated regularly to reflect emerging threats
- Categories include:
  - **A01**: Broken Access Control
  - **A02**: Cryptographic Failures
  - **A03**: Injection
  - **A04**: Insecure Design
  - **A05**: Security Misconfiguration
  - **A06**: Vulnerable and Outdated Components
  - **A07**: Identification and Authentication Failures
  - **A08**: Software and Data Integrity Failures
  - **A09**: Security Logging and Monitoring Failures
  - **A10**: Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)

This repository provides SOC teams and cybersecurity professionals with structured frameworks to enhance security operations and incident response.
